This COVID-19 Pandemic has surely altered lives, challenged academic needs, and adapting to virtual learning has now become the primary gateway to access education. I am indeed proud of you as you have continued to demonstrate diligence, motivation and determination to work to the best of your abilities to learn and support

                        The staff of RCIS have been showing their care and concern for the students by preparing resource materials and engaging classes online for the benefit of students.

                        We have invested in Microsoft Teams, the online platform, by reorganizing campus learning pedagogy into integrated units, blending technology and creativity to provide an uncompromising well-balanced curriculum. Students indeed have found ways to connect, have fun, be supportive, while continuing to learn.

                        The world and humanity will continue to evolve and move forward at a rapid pace. Even as we impart education to match the advancement in technology and globalization, we march our children ahead with ethos of moral values and principles. We endeavour constantly to instil these qualities in our children. We pride ourselves to help them grow and develop into sensitive and responsible citizens of the future.

                        A big hand to all the parents for their continued support. We believe that this is the time to not just deal with the current emergency, but also build foundations of resilience to face ever changing challenges in the future. Variables will change from day-to-day and we need to respond accordingly. How we respond to life’s challenges, makes us stronger and builds our confidence. </p>
